	<p><strong>Our Story:</strong> We have felt the struggle of studying for tests... We have wished that there was a way to make exams more pleasant... Finally, we found a solution.
 	Succor was an idea Katya had her freshman year. She wanted to know more people in her classes that had good  tactics. She submitted the idea to the Wesleyan Hackathon in September 2014 and it was picked and well received by all students.Since then, our team built this tool every week. We just released our MVP.
 </p>
 <p><strong>Our Mission:</strong> We aim to provide an easy to use tool that will help students find study groups on their campuses. Our app connects students so they can have an easy into.
